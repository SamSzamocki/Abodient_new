ROLE DEFINITION:
"Expert at ensuring tenant queries contain all the necessary context to facilitate a resolution"

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. **Clarity Assessment**: Determine if question is clear and relevant to tenancy
2. **Context Gathering**: Collect all necessary contextual information
   - WHAT: Exact problem description
   - WHERE: Location/room/property area
   - WHEN: Timeline and progression
   - HOW: Impact on tenant
   - ATTEMPTS: Previous resolution efforts

RESPONSE VALIDATION CRITERIA:
├─ Question Clarity: Is intent clear?
├─ Relevance Check: Tenancy-related issue?
├─ Context Completeness: All 5 W's answered?
└─ Next Steps: Clarification needed or ready to proceed?

OUTPUT SCHEMA (STRICT JSON):
{
  "is_clear": boolean,
  "is_relevant": boolean, 
  "requires_clarification": boolean,
  "clarifying_question": string,
  "requires_context": boolean,
  "additional_context_question": string,
  "query_summary": string
}

EXAMPLES PROVIDED:
1. Broken Lock → Missing context (which lock, accessibility, timeline)
2. Kitchen Sink Leak → Complete context (location, timeline, attempts, impact)

EXECUTION FLOW SEQUENCE
================================================================================

1. WORKFLOW TRIGGER ACTIVATION
------------------------------
Trigger Source: Main Agent ContextAgent tool call
Input Parameters:
├─ query: "User has a non-functioning fridge that stopped working yesterday..."
├─ chatInput: null
└─ Execution Context: Step 1 of Main Agent workflow

2. INPUT FIELD TRANSFORMATION
-----------------------------
Edit Fields1 Node Processing:
├─ contract_query ← query (original input)
├─ chat_query ← chatInput (null in this case)
└─ Purpose: Standardize input format for AI Agent

3. MEMORY SYSTEM ACTIVATION
---------------------------
Window Buffer Memory Operations:

LOAD MEMORY VARIABLES:
Action: loadMemoryVariables
Context Retrieved: 3 previous conversation turns
Memory Structure:
├─ input: Current query text
├─ system_message: Full Context Agent system prompt
├─ formatting_instructions: JSON schema requirements
└─ chat_history: Previous conversation context

CONVERSATION HISTORY LOADED:
TURN 1: Bathroom door smashed → Context gathering required
├─ Human: "User has an issue with the bathroom door being smashed."
└─ AI: Requested damage details, functionality, timeline

TURN 2: Door damage details provided → Context complete
├─ Human: "Tenant smashed bathroom door with hammer, off hinges yesterday"
└─ AI: Context complete, ready for next workflow step

TURN 3: Fridge not working → Context gathering required  
├─ Human: "User has an issue with their fridge, stating that it is not working."
└─ AI: Requested specific malfunction, timeline, troubleshooting attempts

4. AI PROCESSING ORCHESTRATION
------------------------------
Model Configuration:
├─ Model: gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)
├─ Timeout: 60000ms
├─ Max Retries: 2
├─ Estimated Input Tokens: 1265
└─ Context: Current query + conversation history + system prompt

PROCESSING LOGIC:
Step 1: Load full system prompt with examples
Step 2: Append conversation history for context
Step 3: Analyze current query against 5 W's framework
Step 4: Determine if additional context needed
Step 5: Generate structured JSON response

CONTEXT EVALUATION MATRIX:
├─ WHAT: ✓ "Non-functioning fridge"
├─ WHERE: ? (Assumed kitchen/property)
├─ WHEN: ✓ "Stopped working yesterday"
├─ HOW: ✓ "Power is on, no unusual sounds/temperatures"
├─ ATTEMPTS: ✓ "Haven't tried to fix it"
└─ DECISION: Context sufficient → No further questions needed

5. RESPONSE GENERATION
----------------------
AI Output Generated:
{
  "is_clear": true,
  "is_relevant": true,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "clarifying_question": "",
  "requires_context": false,
  "additional_context_question": "",
  "query_summary": "User's fridge stopped working yesterday, the power is on, and they haven't noticed any unusual sounds or temperatures. They haven't attempted any fixes yet."
}

TOKEN USAGE METRICS:
├─ Prompt Tokens: 1280 (system + history + current query)
├─ Completion Tokens: 86
├─ Total Tokens: 1366
├─ Model: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
└─ Finish Reason: stop

6. MEMORY UPDATE OPERATION
--------------------------
SAVE CONTEXT:
Action: saveContext
New Context Added:
├─ input: Current query
├─ system_message: Full prompt
├─ formatting_instructions: JSON schema
├─ chat_history: Updated with new turn
└─ output: Generated JSON response

Memory Persistence: Context saved for future Main Agent calls

================================================================================
INPUT/OUTPUT DATA FLOW
================================================================================

INPUT RECEIVED FROM MAIN AGENT:
Raw Query: "User has a non-functioning fridge that stopped working yesterday, hasn't noticed any unusual sounds or temperatures, hasn't tried to fix it, but the power is on."

CONTEXT ANALYSIS PERFORMED:
✓ Clarity: Query is clear and specific
✓ Relevance: Appliance malfunction is tenancy-related
✓ Context Completeness:
  - Problem: Non-functioning fridge (WHAT)
  - Timeline: Started yesterday (WHEN)  
  - Status: Power on, no sounds/temps (HOW)
  - Attempts: None tried yet (ATTEMPTS)
  - Location: Implied residential property (WHERE)

DECISION LOGIC:
Since all critical context elements are present, no additional questions needed.
Query is ready for next workflow step (contract/classifier analysis).

OUTPUT RETURNED TO MAIN AGENT:
Structured JSON confirming query completeness and providing summary.

================================================================================
MEMORY CONTINUITY SYSTEM
================================================================================

SESSION MANAGEMENT:
├─ Persistent Memory: Maintains context across tool calls
├─ Conversation Tracking: 3 previous turns loaded
├─ Context Window: Efficiently manages token usage
└─ State Preservation: Query history influences current analysis

MEMORY INTEGRATION POINTS:
1. LOAD: Previous conversations inform current context evaluation
2. PROCESS: Historical patterns help determine completeness
3. SAVE: New interaction added to conversation history
4. PERSIST: Memory available for subsequent Main Agent calls

CONVERSATION PROGRESSION INSIGHT:
Turn 1-2: Bathroom door issue → Context gathering → Resolution
Turn 3-4: Fridge issue (previous) → Context gathering → In progress  
Turn 5: Fridge issue (current) → Context complete → Ready for next step

================================================================================
TOOL INTEGRATION ORCHESTRATION
================================================================================

MAIN AGENT TOOL INTEGRATION:
├─ Tool Name: "ContextAgent"
├─ Description: "Call this agent to get more context on the question"
├─ Workflow ID: BAa1dwbqTsN59O4s
├─ Execution Method: Execute Workflow Trigger
└─ Return Path: JSON response back to Main Agent

INPUT SCHEMA FLEXIBILITY:
├─ Primary: query parameter (main input)
